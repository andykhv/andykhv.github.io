# Hello World!
Greetings fellow netizens! ðŸ¤“

I've recently thinking about creating a blog for awhile. I've thought about wanting to convey matters that I experience, consume, and study. I think I just really wanted a method of self-expression and an archive of my thoughts! There are instances where I implemented some code, read a book, or watched a movie, and had some leftover thoughts that I wanted to jot down somewhere. A diary could have been a plausible choice here, but I prefer some form of digital footprint for this content.

The other aspect of this blog is to improve the organization and conveyance of my thoughts, ideas, and other complex subject matter that I come across. I hope this will translate to an improvement in my speaking ability as well.

Also, the styling of this blog may change ever so often!

Cheers!
